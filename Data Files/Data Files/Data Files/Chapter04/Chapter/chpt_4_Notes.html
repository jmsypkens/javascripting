    <!-- Javascript error types
    ========================================== --> 

    <!-- 1. Syntax errors:
            When the interpreter fails to recognize code. 
            
            ex. --> 
            <script>
                document.wtir("Hello World"); //mispelling of document.write
            </script>    
            
            
   <!-- 2. Run-Time Errors:
            When interpreter encounters program with code it is trying to execute.
            
            ex. If you call a function and that function has not been created. 
    
    3. Logic Errors
            When a flaw in the design of a program prevents it from running as
            anticipated. Logic refers to the exectution of program statements and 
            procedures in the correct order to produce the desired results. 
            
            ex. --> 
            <script>
                var multiplicationResult = 10 / 3; // should be a ('*')
                document.write("Ten multiplied by three is " + 
                    multiplicationResult); 
            </script>
            
    <!-- DEBUGGING METHODS 
    ========================================== --> 
    
    <!-- window.alert() Debugging method 
        1. Use window.alert("//insert variable, array or value returned from 
            function") in different points in your program to display
            values as they change during program execution. Ex: --> 
            
            <script>
                function addNumbers(a,b) {
                    var result = a - b;
                window.alert(result); // checks value of result and shows incorrect    
                    return result; 
                }   
            
                addNumbers(200, 300); 
            </script>
            
       <!-- console.log() Debugging method 
        2. Use console.log("//insert value") Can log a string, variable or 
        combination of the two. Ex: --> 
            
            <script>
                function calcPay(a,b) {
                    var payRate = a; 
                    var numHours = b; 
                    var grossPay = payRate * numHours; 
                console.log("grossPay is: " + grossPay) // note indentation
                    return grossPay; 
                }
                
                calcPay(50, 40); 
            </script>
            
        <!-- 3. using /* test */ to comment out code --> 
        
        
        <!-- Programming Concept: Dependencies 
            Any program longer than a handful of statements that depend on
            the successful execution of other statments or functions. --> 
            
        <!-- Reporting Bugs 
            Do: - Describe in detail the steps required to produce the error.
                - Describe the expected results from steps and what you observed instead. 
                - Provide exact text of any error message. -->
